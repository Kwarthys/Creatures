# Creatures
Genetic Algorythm 'n' Neural Networks can survive !

Here are small tiny little creatures that will try to learn how to live !

Each Creature has a Brain, e.g a Neural Network randomly generated at strart. 
Next, natural selection will strike and by chance, creatures will become more and more intelligent !
They have a stomach, and two nostrils. So they can smell the nearest food (little green dots),
and know when they or starving or near overfeeding.

A brain is actually a set of matrixes, each value representing a weigth between two neurons.
(Clicking a creatues will (hopefully) display the weigths and the current state of its Brain.)

The structure of the Brain is determined in the code. My Brain class can create and compute any straight-forward neural networks, with a flexible constructor. (e.g Brain(2,5,5,5,3) will create a Brain with 2 inputs, three hiddens layer of 5 neurons, and 3 outputs neurons.)
Each Brain has N states matrixes, one by layer, and N-1 weigths matrixes.
