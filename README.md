# Creatures
Genetic Algorythm 'n' Neural Networks can survive !

Here are small tiny little creatures that will try to learn how to live !

Each Creature has a Brain, e.g a Neural Network randomly generated at strart. 
Next, natural selection will strike and by chance, creatures will become more and more intelligent !
They have a stomach, and two nostrils. So they can smell the nearest food (little green dots),
and know when they or starving or near overfeeding.

A brain is actually a set of matrixes, each value representing a weigth between two neurons.
(Clicking a creatues will (hopefully) display the weigths and the current state of its Brain.)

The structure of the Brain is, for now, hard-coded. 3 inputs neurons, 1 middle layout (Hidden) of 3 neurons and 3 outputs neurons.
Therefore, each Brain has 3 states matrixes, one for each layout, and 2 weigths matrixes. Inputs to Hidden, and Hidden to Outputs.
